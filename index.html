                Sodi Kroehler is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, 
                majoring in computer science and a minoring in philosophy. 
                After growing up in and then leaving the religious group known 
                as the Twelve Tribes in order to pursue an education, Sodi 
                has now become a terrible artist, pictured left. <br><br> He is hoping to
                 continue his education as PhD student next year, focusing on 
                 the interplay between ethics and AI applications. He is 
                 especially excited to work on misinformation-reduction 
                 technologies.<br><br>
                Outside of school, he is involved in several school organizations,
                 such as the Computer Science Club and the Alpha Kappa Psi 
                 professional fraternity. He also serves as the technical 
                 director for Sudan Rebirth Ministry, a charity focused 
                 on providing academic scholarships for children in South Sudan.
                 <br><br>
                  He is also an avid writer, having recently published his
                   first feature-length book, “Homo Stultus - for gods”.
