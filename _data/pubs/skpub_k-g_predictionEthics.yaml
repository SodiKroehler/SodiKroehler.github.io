- abstract: "This paper studied six individuals on various ethical values and argued that existing value systems (deontological, Nichomachean, utilitarian) could not adequately explain observed answers. It proposed a new underlying theory utilizing the desire to minimize prediction as a central force alongside evolution, better explaining the observed interviews."
