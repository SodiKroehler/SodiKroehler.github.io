- abstract: "A brief article detailing observations from a political chatbot made by Spotlight PA, which opened a chatbot for voters during the 2024 presidential election. We found that traditional red-teaming wasn't sufficient, and that primary areas of harm were: non-answers, translations, trust-reducing areas, and confusing question framings."
