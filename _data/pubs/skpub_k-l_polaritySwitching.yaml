- abstract: "This article extends previous work by 'translating' news articles from one leaning to another - i.e., 'right' to 'left' or vice versa. In addition, it can also train for other aspects, such as increasing/decreasing average word length, removing profanity, etc. It uses guide words at the beginning of the phrase, along with a GAN-trained model to achieve this."
