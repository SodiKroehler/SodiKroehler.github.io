  abstract: "Between August and November 5th, 2024, the Spotlight News team deployed an experimental chatbot on their public-facing website to assist users in navigating the complexities of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Following the election, an anonymized dataset of user queries and chatbot responses was shared with researchers from the University of Pittsburgh’s PICSO Lab and Pitt Cyber. The goal was to rigorously evaluate the system’s performance, political neutrality, and factual reliability using a combination of human annotation and computational analysis. This report presents the complete findings of that evaluation"
